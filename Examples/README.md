# Examples

Simple examples to quickly learn the language.

To enter an example in TeraTerm:

```
new
edit
```

This puts the user into EDIT mode.  Now copy the code from a notepad,
and paste it using the TeraTerm's paste key function (ALT + V) or
select it from the TeraTerm's Edit menu dropdown.

After pasting or typing the code.
```
Press the F1 key to save (and leave EDIT mode).

type RUN
```

This invokes the program. 

By the way, your code is saved within the Pico, so the next time you connect it to the desktop
the code is stil there.
